# Kawa-HotSwap
## A 32 key 'fixed-split' pro-micro based keyboard with a 128x64 OLED display.

Forked from CoffeeBreakKeyboards [here](https://github.com/CoffeeBreakKeyboards/kawa) and updated to use Kailh Hotswap Sockets. 

A sandwich mount case was also created based on the original Kawa PCB footprint. The central section around the OLED and controller board is covered with a sheet of acrylic.
