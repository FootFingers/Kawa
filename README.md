# Kawa-HotSwap
## A 32 key 'fixed-split' pro-micro based keyboard with a 128x64 OLED display.

Forked from CoffeeBreakKeyboards [here](https://github.com/CoffeeBreakKeyboards/kawa) and updated to use Kailh Hotswap Sockets. 

A sandwich mount case was also created based on the original Kawa PCB footprint. The central section around the OLED and controller board is covered with a sheet of acrylic, and hardware has been added to provide wireless support.

## Case
Plate files created:
 - Base Plate x1
 - Top Plate x2
 - Acrylic Centre Guard x1

## Firmware

Firmware files are available [here](https://github.com/sofubi/qmk_firmware/tree/kawa/rev0.1/keyboards/handwired/kawa)

Wireless firmware is still currently in development.

## Usage

Use these files at your own risk. This project is currently in development, and as such is likely to contain issues. 

## ToDo
- [ ] Wireless Firmware
- [ ] Build Guide
- [x] PCB updated to use hotswap sockets
- [x] Sandwich Mount Case + Acrylic Component Cover
